## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This program is a Blackjack game between the user and a programed dealer. The program creates a deck of cards with text, keeps track of scores based on the cards values, and simulates turns to follow the rules of a basic version of Blackjack.

The program is built up of 11 classes total. The classes Card, Deck, Rank, and Suit were created to build the virtual deck of cards to be played with by methods in other classes. They deck class using the other three classes to create a standard 52 card deck with proper ranks and suits. It also includes the methods to check the deck size, deal the cards, and shuffle the cards.




The grading requirements for this project are:
-  Your program must NOT be contained in one procedural main(). You MUST design a OO class structure.
- When the game begins both the player and dealer are dealt two cards.
- If a player or dealer is dealt 21 the game is over. Otherwise the player can choose to hit as many times as they wish until they choose to stay.
- Once the player has completed their turn the dealer will begin their turn, automatically hitting or staying according to the Blackjack rules.
- The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.
- The winner is displayed.
